# CareerWiz

**Description **
Deploying the project as a solution to digitally assist career-counsellors  to streamline their workflow


User is evaluated on the basis of 2 personality tests:
   • The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality test 
   • The Holland code test – for career preference



MBTI divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axes:
  • Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E) 
  • Intuition (N) – Sensing (S) 
  • Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)
  • Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)

**FINAL Conclusion **


We developed a data-driven solution leveraging machine learning and Natural Language Processing
Paradigms to predict a test-taker’s MBTI personality-type and then present them with a questionnaire
enquiring about their career-preferences which are aligned to the test-taker’s respective MBTI personalitytype, thereby achieving the objective of giving personalized career-recommendations to test-takers.

As the professional world progresses towards more optimization and synchronicity in hiring processes and
rely more heavily on external tests which measure the compatibility or suitability of a prospective jobcandidate, frameworks like the MBTI axis are turning out to be helpful as evident by their extensive use by
the HR departments of almost all major organizations. 

In order to make our model keep up with the ever-changing landscape of Natural Language Processing and
the ways in which people express themselves textually, we plan on periodically retraining our algorithms in
the backend on newer datasets. These newer datasets will be sourced from 2 avenues, one being the CareerWiz
website itself, which will store the textual inputs made by the test-takers in a database, only after taking their
permission, and the other source being the web-scrapers which we will eventually develop and deploy to
scrape off data from websites like Reddit which are a treasure trove of actual, legitimate, and labelled textual
data.
